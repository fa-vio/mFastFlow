# mFastFlow

[**FastFlow**](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/dokuwiki/doku.php/ffnamespace:about) is a parallel programming framework implemented as a C++ template library, that offers a set of mechanisms to support low-latency and high-bandwidth data flows in a network of threads running on multi-core and many-cores architectures.

**_mFastFlow_** is simply a lightweight FastFlow repository, where samples, tests, documentations and other miscellanoeus stuff has been dropped. mFastFlow does not limt FastFlow functionalities in any way, nor changes any of its logics and features.
